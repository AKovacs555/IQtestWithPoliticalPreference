# IQtestWithPoliticalPreference

This is a simple Flask web application that presents a short IQ quiz and asks which political party the user supports. Results are stored anonymously and aggregated to show summary statistics.

## Setup

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-WTF Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

Run the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The quiz is for entertainment/research purposes only and does not collect any personal information.
